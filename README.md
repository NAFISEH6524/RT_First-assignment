# Introduction

This code is a solution to a robotic challenge of finding silver and golden tokens. The robot uses two functions drive and turn to move linearly and angularly respectively. There are two functions find_silver_token and find_gold_token to find the closest silver and golden tokens respectively. The robot keeps running until it finds 6 golden tokens and stores their codes in the gold_list.

# Requirements

To run the code, you will need the sr library installed. The library can be installed by running pip install sr in the terminal.

# How the code works

  *  The robot is initialized using the R = Robot() line.
  *  The code keeps running in a while loop until it finds 6 golden tokens.
  *  The flag silverflag determines whether the robot is looking for a silver token or a golden token.
  *  If silverflag is True, the function find_silver_token is called and the closest silver token is searched.
  *  If a silver token is found, the code checks if the distance between the robot and the token is less than d_threshold. If it is, the robot attempts to grab the token. If the grab is successful, the code of the token is added to the silver_list and the flag silverflag is set to False.
  *  If silverflag is False, the function find_gold_token is called and the closest golden token is searched.
  *  The process for grabbing a golden token is similar to the silver token.
  *  If the robot is not aligned with the token, it uses the turn function to rotate. If the token is close, it uses the drive function to move forward.
  *  The robot will release the silver token that has grabbed next to the golden token that is found.

# Conclusion

This code provides a solution for the challenge of finding silver and golden tokens using the sr library. The robot moves linearly and angularly using the drive and turn functions, and finds the tokens using the find_silver_token and find_gold_token functions.
